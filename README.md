## IBT610 Computational Genomics (previously BTN707)

### Textbook
* KU library - [Introduction to Computational Genomics : A Case Studies Approach](https://library.korea.ac.kr/detail/?cid=CAT000045342204&ctype=m)

### Term project guideline

* Windows10 users - if you like to use `linux` (unix) environment, install [WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/ko-kr/windows/wsl/install)
* For python coding: use following tools (optional) 
  * [`conda`](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - virtual environment control
    * [conda tutorial](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) 
  * [`Pycharm`](https://www.jetbrains.com/ko-kr/pycharm/download/) - Integrated Development Environment (IDE), 통합개발환경
    * [pycharm tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html) 
* All individual projects will be maintained in the [Github `BTN707` repository](https://github.com/choilab/2021-compgen-class/)
  * What is `Git` and `Github`?
    * [생활코딩 Git](https://opentutorials.org/module/3733/22434)
    * [What is `Github`?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)
    * __it is not an obligation__
* Use `markdown` for documentation
  * [Markdown tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  * [Markdown tutorial - Korean](https://github.com/biospin/BigBio/blob/master/reference/%EB%A7%88%ED%81%AC%EB%8B%A4%EC%9A%B4.md)
* You can use [`jupyter notebook`](https://jupyter.org/) too
* Check [library](https://library.korea.ac.kr/) - there are plenty of reference books for python codings
* __Evaluation is on your *activity* rather than your *performance* (e.g. how frequently commit/update your codes/documents/discussions)__

### Term projects 
- You can choose following topics or suggest your own term project
- In following weeks, everyone will present and discuss about his/her intro/progress/issues/results, including 
  - i) what is the problem to solve? (_topic description/introduction_), 
  - ii) why is it important? (_biological meaning_), 
  - iii) how it can be solved (_algorithms/procedures_) - _how do you solve the problem?_ 
- Some projects are mostly related to `indexing` and `pattern matching` of sequences, which was handled in the previous class hours.
