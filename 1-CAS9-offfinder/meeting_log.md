#Meeting report from README


#### hyunju's memo that introduction will include
- what CRISPR is
- what we want to do by coding CAS off finder
- how existing CAS off finder works

As I write it, it is similar to Thinkabouts,,,

---

Divide parts to explaining basic concept and telling CAS-off-finder.


We should include our direction(what we are going to do refer to CAS-off-finder).



---
until this week(11/1),
- we will make list of Cas system
- we chose 30 types of Cas system
- record in table format to read well


---
until next week(11/2),
- we focus on how to use Cas OFFinder's off-target finding tool
- off-target has meaning ? -> Is it meaningful ? -> Let's find readings which contain both "off-target" & "function"

---
after 11/04 meet up,
- we decided to focus on Mycoplasma-specific Cas system Finder
- Why Mycoplasma? -> the smallest genome in the world
- we have to find some meaning of off-target -> maybe interview C.H. Jung Prof.'s lab
---
after 11/15 meet up,
- we try to explain "problems of off target" from interview of CH Jung prof's lab member.
- our process is trying to figure out Cas Offinder's off target finding tool.
- we investigate list of Cas system from Cas-off-finder.

---

after 11/22 meet up,
- we decided not to focus on specific genome. It will be used on any kind of genomes which is FASTA.
- we should include OFF target story on presentation.
- we found CRISPR gDNA software(from Genious) which can find whole information about input gDNA.
- so, we thought our project is combining Genious and OFFinder called "How is suit gDNA to CRISPR"
- we made more detailed project flow.

24 Nov. presentation 
- What is CAS OFFinder 
- How it works
- What are the advantages 
- Analysis of the results from two different software i.e. Geneious prime and CRISPR RGEN tools


---
After final presentation, 

- genome, gene -> gene knockout editing oligo set
- PAM -> find gRNA -> optimal (off target X, PAM distance mismatch) -> score
- investigate how CRISPOR scoring system works.
