# Lactobacillus Genome Statistics (NCBI, October 16, 2025)

An updated summary of Lactobacillus genomes available on the NCBI Assembly Genome Browser, including registration, availability for download, and annotation status. This table also includes the official reference genome count.

| Category                                   | Count  | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Total genome assemblies                     | 5,427  | All registered Lactobacillus genomes (includes drafts and complete)        |
| Downloadable genome assemblies              | 5,427  | All assemblies can be downloaded directly via NCBI datasets portal         |
| Annotated genomes (GenBank/RefSeq)          | 3,329  | Assemblies with annotation either from GenBank submitters or NCBI RefSeq   |
| NCBI RefSeq-annotated genomes               | 2,326  | Assemblies specifically annotated by NCBI RefSeq, usually via PGAP         |
| Official reference genomes                  | 49     | Genomes officially designated as NCBI Reference Genomes                    |

- Most annotated genomes have both GenBank submitter and NCBI RefSeq annotation
- “NCBI RefSeq-annotated” means annotation by NCBI using their Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP)
- “Reference genomes” are curated, high-quality representatives for each species
