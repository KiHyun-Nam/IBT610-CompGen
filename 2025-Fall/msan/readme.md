# Lactobacillus Genome Statistics (as of October 16, 2025, NCBI)

Below is a summary table of the current status of Lactobacillus genome registration, downloadability, and annotation. All statistics are sourced from the official NCBI Assembly Genome Browser.

| Category                         | Count  | Description                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Total genome assemblies           | 5,427  | All registered genomes, regardless of assembly level (includes drafts)     |
| Downloadable assemblies           | 5,427  | All genomes are available for download on the NCBI datasets portal         |
| Annotated genomes (GenBank/RefSeq)| 3,329  | Assemblies with either GenBank submitter annotation or NCBI RefSeq annotation |
| RefSeq-annotated genomes (PGAP)   | 2,326  | Genomes annotated by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) |

- **All genomes listed are downloadable directly from the NCBI datasets page**
- **Annotated genomes** include those with annotations provided by GenBank submitters or NCBI RefSeq
- **RefSeq-annotated genomes** are those specifically processed by NCBI's PGAP
