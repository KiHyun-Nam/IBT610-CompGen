Gene Assembly Designer
*Input: gene/gene cluster/chromosome
*Output: a pool of variable lengths of oligos/fragments (overlapped) for synthetic full gene
*Options: ssDNA/dsDNA/overlap length/# of fragments/restriction site removal
*Thinkabouts: i) what is the problem to solve?, ii) why is it important? (biological meaning), iii) how can you design/build/test?...
*Example program & literature4 - Assmebly PCR oligo Maker

## Gene Assembly
-Restriction enzyme-based (BioBrick assembly, Golden Gate assembly)
-Sequence homology-based (Gibson assembly, SLIC, Overlap PCR, DNA assembler)
 -in vitro/in vivo
-Bridging oligo-based (LCR)
