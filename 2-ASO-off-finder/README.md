# Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) off-target finder

ASO-off-finder is a program that finds potential off-targets in the genome sequence for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) sequences.

## Program

* Input: target genome sequence and oligonucleotide sequence (FASTA format)
* Output: target and off-target site coordinate
* Options: # of allowed mismatches/insertion/deletion/base ambiguity

## Thinkabouts

* What is the problem to solve?
    1. What is Antisense oligonucleotide?
    2. ASO off-target?
* Why is it important? (biological meaning)
* How should we solve the problem?
    1. pre-existing methods to detect ASO off-targets
    2. new methods to try?
