# Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) off-target finder

ASO-off-finder is a program that finds potential off-targets in the genome sequence for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) sequences.

## Program

* Input: target genome sequence and oligonucleotide sequence (FASTA format)
* Output: target and off-target site coordinate
* Options: # of allowed mismatches/insertion/deletion/base ambiguity
